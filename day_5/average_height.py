# Instructions
# You are going to write a program that calculates the average student height from a List of heights.

# e.g. student_heights = [180, 124, 165, 173, 189, 169, 146]

# The average height can be calculated by adding all the heights together and dividing by the total number of heights.


# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code below ğŸ‘‡
student_heights = input("Input a list of student heights ").split()
for n in range(0, len(student_heights)):
  student_heights[n] = int(student_heights[n])
# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code above ğŸ‘†


#Write your code below this row ğŸ‘‡
sum = 0

#loop through items in the list and add each item to sum

for height in student_heights:
    sum += height

#calculate average
average = sum / (len(student_heights))

#round to nearest whole number

print(int(round(average)))
